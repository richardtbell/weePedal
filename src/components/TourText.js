This is a wonderful day out on the bikes if you are looking for a longer ride.
We shall join the start of the Union Canal which was first in use in 1832 and cycle 
alongside the canal to Falkirk with scenic rest / refreshment stops en route. 
You can visit and go on the impressive Falkirk Wheel in action (entrance fee not included) and experience engineering at it’s very best connecting the Forth and Clyde Canal. 
There is a well serviced cafe at The Falkirk Wheel so you can have lunch there or stop 3/4 of way back at The Bridge Inn in Ratho (8 miles outside Edinburgh )
