Canals, aqueducts, railways, gardens, beaches, mountains and tunnels. This tour is approx 18 miles and we will stop for refreshments on the way. It is mainly flat but Edinburgh is built on 7 hills, so there will be some small short inclines along the way. We take our time and allow you to take lots of photos, which, I guarantee, you will take lots! We will circle Edinburgh city and will never be more than 2 miles from the centre. I shall give you a background about our route and give historical facts and information.",
